        <h2>Anayzing Insurance Claims Patterns</h2>
        
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Insurance companies handle a significant amount of transaction data from claims. Understanding patterns in these claims can help companies manage risks, optimize pricing, and detect fraudulent claims.</p>
        
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>How can insurance companies identify key patterns in claims data to better predict high-cost claims and improve risk management?</p>
        
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>The primary goal of this analysis is to identify patterns in claims, and provide actionable insights that insurance companies can use to optimize their operations.</p>
        
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>We will be working on the “Claims Data” table from the following Insurance Claims Fraud Dataset from Kaggle.</p>
        <img src="tableextract.png" alt="Claims Data Table">
        
        <h3>I - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
        <p>We will begin by loading the dataset and examining its structure to understand the variables available for analysis. This initial review will help us identify any missing values, data types, and potential inconsistencies.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Cleansing</h3>
        <p>Before diving into the analysis, we must ensure that our data is clean and ready for exploration as missing data can skew our results and lead to incorrect conclusions.</p>
        
        <h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>Now that we have a clean dataset, we want to get a sense of the data and identify trends that could be relevant to our analysis.</p>
        <p>First of all, we want to identify the basic statistical properties of our claims and premium amounts in order to understand the central tendencies and variability within the dataset. Let's calculate the descriptive statistics (mean, median, frequency…) for claims and premium amounts.</p>
        <img src="table1.png" alt="Descriptive Statistics Table">
        
        <h3>Distribution of Claim Amounts</h3>
        <p>Next, we want to analyze the distribution of claim amounts to reveal information about typical claim sizes and identify any unusual values.</p>

        <h3>Identify Patterns in Claims</h3>
        <p>To further inform our analysis, we want to identify key patterns that could help in risk management strategies.</p>
        <p>Let’s examine trends in claims over time to understand seasonality and identify periods of high claim activity. We will group claims by month and year to see how they fluctuate.</p>
        <img src="graph2.png" alt="Trends in Claims Over Time">
        
        <h3>Claims by Insurance Type</h3>
        <p>We also want to understand which types of insurance have the highest claims to help in risk assessment. Let's aggregate claim amounts by insurance type.</p>
        <img src="graph3.png" alt="Claims by Insurance Type">
        
        <h3>Correlation Analysis</h3>
        <p>Finally, we want to visualize the relationships between premium amounts and claim amounts. This will help us determine if there’s a relationship between the amount paid in premiums and the amount claimed.</p>
        <img src="graph4.png" alt="Correlation Analysis">
        
        <h3>Conclusion and Recommendations</h3>
        <p>This analysis highlights key patterns in insurance claims that can enhance risk management and pricing strategies for insurers. Our findings revealed several insights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Claim amounts vary significantly, with a notable concentration of claims at lower amounts and a few high-cost outliers that merit attention.</li>
            <li>Seasonal trends indicate increased claims during year-end celebrations, which may relate to heightened risks during this period.</li>
            <li>The life insurance sector emerges as particularly risky due to its high average claim amounts.</li>
            <li>The weak relationship between premium amounts and claimed amounts suggests that other underlying variables may better explain claim behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To optimize operations, insurers should consider implementing targeted strategies for high-cost claims, especially around peak periods, and adjust premium pricing to align with observed risk patterns. Further exploration into customer behavior and claim context could provide additional insights for effective risk management.</p>
